ENPIPE(1)                                                            ENPIPE(1)



NAME
       enpipe - pipe shoving

SYNOPSIS
       enpipe [ -in ] [ -o outfile ] command-line

DESCRIPTION
       Enpipe runs command-line, substituting arguments consisting solely of -
       for a temporary file where standard input is sent to, effectively forc‐
       ing  the  named  program  to work in a pipeline.  If no - is found, the
       temporary file's name is added to the end of command-line.   If  either
       -i  or  -n are passed (they are equivalent), this is not done (allowing
       enpipe to start a pipe or keep standard input).

       By default, the program's standard output is copied to standard output.
       The  -o  option  sends the program's standard output nowhere and, after
       the program runs, copies the named file  to  standard  output  instead.
       This is done even if the program fails.

       Enpipe  returns the exit status of the program run, except if something
       happens before the program runs.

EXAMPLES
       View an online image and a local one in eog(1):

              curl http://example.com/file.png | enpipe eog - local.png

       Process a tex(1) document, converting it to a PDF:

              echo '\end' | enpipe -i -o paper.dvi tex paper.tex |
                   enpipe dvips -f | ps2pdf > paper.pdf

       (On some systems, ps2pdf(1) may need an option or argument such as  the
       dummy filename - to read standard input.)

FILES
       /tmp/enpipestdinXXXXXX

              Standard input is shoved to these files.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Enpipe  prints  its  own  error messages and quits if something happens
       while trying to run the program.  Programs are run through  sh(1);  its
       diagnostics  will be used as well.  Enpipe prints an error if something
       happens while copying outfile but  will  quit  with  the  error  status
       returned  by  the  program.  The temporary standard input file is never
       deleted.

BUGS
       That this program exists.  (I may be thinking the problem —  that  some
       modern  Unix  programs  don't like to work in pipelines — may be larger
       than it actually is, but this program is here anwyay.  Another issue  I
       have  is  that  more  programs  require - for standard input and output
       nowadays, but that's a problem enpipe can't fix.)

       There should be a more general way to insert the  input  filename.   If
       there  is a program that uses filename to determine file type, a provi‐
       sion for that would also be desirable.

       -o should probably send program standard output to the terminal.

       If attempting to launch the shell to run  the  program  fails,  outfile
       will  still  be  read.  In fact, if this behavior is reversed, wouldn't
       that make enpipe not behave like an actual pipe program?
